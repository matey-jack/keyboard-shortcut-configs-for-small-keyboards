# Application keymaps for small keyboards

Computer keyboards with less than 80 keys simulate keypresses of the "missing keys" using key combinations. 
This ranges from simple things like Fn+1 to simulate the F1 key or Fn+Up to simulate PageUp, 
to a complex layer system where all 80+ or even 100+ keys of a traditional "full-size" keyboard are simulated.
While being fully functional, this holding of the Fn key (or any other layer switching key) becomes awkward
when yet another modifier needs to be held down to create a shortcut. For example, Rename in IntelliJ is Shift+F6, 
which on a small keyboard is entered as Shift+Fn+6. 
Or switching workspaces in Ubuntu Linux is Ctrl+PageUp/-Down which becomes Ctrl+Fn+PageUp/-Down. 
Depending on the position of the modifier keys, this can become difficult to press, might need both hands,
or even be difficult with both hands.

While one solution to this problem is better keyboard layout design, another solution is to configure different shortcuts in apps which make that possible.
One great example is Ubuntu's shortcut to switch windows within one application, Alt+`.
This shortcut is easy to remember because ` on the US keyboard layout is right next to Tab and Esc which are also used for other kinds of window switching. 
Since the ` key is often moved away on smaller keyboard layouts to make place for Esc, one easy way to keep the shortcut alive is to map it to Alt+Esc instead. (I did this, because I never used the other shortcut that is out-of-the-box assigned to Alt+Esc.)
